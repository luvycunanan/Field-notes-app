# FIELD NOTES

This project is created to allow users like myself to organize their travel Itineraries.
I mainly built this project so that I have a way of organizing my travels.

## Tech Stack

MERN

## User Stories

1. User can create destinations, which is 
   basically their travel destination.
2. The user can also add Spots, spots can be 
   that certain tourist spot that you've always 
   wanted to visit in your dream travel sestination.
3. The user can Add, Edit, and Delete a Spot as
   well as a destination.
4. When a destination is selected from the dropdown 
   list, google's geocode runs and passes down 
   coordinates of the spots to google maps api which 
   then pins the spots on the map.


## Roadmap

Some future features i'd like to add:

   ### Auth
      To allow users to signup and login
   
   ### Travel checklist
      This one feature will definitely be beneficial, pretty much a packing list so you won't forget your charger again! Reuse the same list for when its time to go back home or move on to the next destination, so that you wont leave your charger!
   
   ### Calendar 
      For better travel organizing. This will allow users to add dates for the trip and spots
   
   ### Spot notes 
      To enter some travel notes on spots like that travel tip you heard from a youtuber or your neighborhood traveler
   
   ### Sub spots
      To maybe add sub spots(ex: parks, stores) to visit around a spot
   
   ### Map search 
      Who doesn't like just browsing the map and discover some random spot?
   
   ### Randomize
      When randomize is clicked it will generate some random place for you to visits, can be filtered within country, city, region, etc.
